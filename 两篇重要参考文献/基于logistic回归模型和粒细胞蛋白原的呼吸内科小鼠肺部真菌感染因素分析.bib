abstract = {The objective of this research is to solve the current medical problems of a high incidence of fungal infections in the lungs, high misdiagnosis rate, and high mortality. In this study, firstly, the logistic regression model was used to conduct. Risk factors of pulmonary fungal infection in respiratory department were analyzed. Then a model of pulmonary fungal infection in mice was constructed, and the expression difference of Progranulin (PGRN) in serum was detected by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of PGRN in lung tissues of mice infected by pulmonary fungi was detected by Western bolt method and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PGRN protein and mRNA expression in the lung epithelial cells of mice were detected after the infection. Results logistic regression model was used to analyze the main risk factors affecting pulmonary infection in mice. The risk factors of pulmonary fungal infection were indent catheter, hypoproteinemia, long-term use of glucocorticoid and long-term use of antibiotics. The PGRN content in serum was obviously higher than that before pulmonary fungal infection (P < 0.01). The expression of PGRN mRNA and protein in lung tissue was obviously higher than that before infection (P < 0.01). The expression of PGRN mRNA and protein in lung tissues of the infected group was obviously higher than that of the non-infected group (P < 0.01). The expression of PGRN protein in the lung epithelial cells of mice was obviously higher at 24 h after infection than before infection (P < 0.01), and the expression of PGRN mRNA was obviously higher at 12 h after infection than before infection (P < 0.01), indicating that PGRN is highly expressed in fungal pulmonary infection and is involved in disease progression. Therefore, this study provides a new idea for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal pulmonary infection in the later stage and has a good guiding significance for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal pulmonary infection.}
